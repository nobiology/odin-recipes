        <h2>With an Instant Pot and simple ingredients like carrots and potatoes, you can have a flavorful, comforting pot roast in less time than using an oven or slow cooker.</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>3 pounds beef chuck roast</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>1 pound baby potatoes</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups baby carrots</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
            <li>1 packet dry onion soup mix</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) set to the Saute function. Add roast to hot oil and cook until browned all over, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Pour in broth.</li>
            <li>Combine potatoes, carrots, onion, soup mix, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake until vegetables are evenly coated. Pour mixture into the pressure cooker and spread out evenly.</li>
            <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to the manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 60 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for the pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Release the pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to the manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Transfer roast and vegetables to a serving platter.</li>
            <li>Select the saute function and bring drippings to a boil. Combine water and cornstarch in a bowl; pour into the drippings. Cook, stirring frequently, until gravy is slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with garlic salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Slice roast and serve with vegetables and gravy.</li>
        </ol>
